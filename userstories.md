1. Automatic Queue Management
As a match organizer,
I want the system to automatically manage the queue of players for game matches,
so that I don’t have to manually assign players every round.

Acceptance Criteria:
The system automatically assigns players to available courts based on the total number of players and courts.
After each round, the players who were on break are rotated back into the match, while new players are placed on break.
The scheduling algorithm factors in the rule (e.g., with 3 courts and 18 players, 6 players are on break each round).
2. Player Level Balancing
As a match organizer,
I want the system to take into account each player’s skill level,
so that the matches are balanced and competitive.

Acceptance Criteria:
Each player’s level is stored and maintained in the system.
The queueing algorithm uses player levels to create balanced matches.
There is an option for organizers to adjust the balancing parameters if needed.
3. Equal Game Participation
As a player,
I want to be sure that every participant gets an equal opportunity to play and take breaks,
so that no one is overburdened or left out.

Acceptance Criteria:
The system tracks the number of games played by each player.
It ensures that across rounds, every player gets a fair amount of playing time and break time.
The scheduling logic prevents the same players from continuously playing or being benched.
4. Real-Time Queue and Match Updates
As a match organizer or player,
I want to see real-time updates on the queue and upcoming match assignments,
so that everyone is informed about their turn and current game status.

Acceptance Criteria:
The app displays a live queue and schedule that updates as matches finish.
Notifications or visual indicators inform users when they are about to join the next game.
The system accommodates last-minute changes while keeping the queue updated.
5. Balanced Game Types (Hard vs. Mixed)
As a match organizer,
I want the system to alternate between “hard games” and “mixed games,”
so that the matches remain varied and enjoyable.

Acceptance Criteria:
The system allows setting game type preferences (hard games, mixed games, or a mix).
It prevents scheduling consecutive hard games unless explicitly overridden.
The match assignment logic considers past game types to maintain variety.
6. Configurable Game Settings
As an admin,
I want the ability to configure key settings (e.g., number of courts, match duration, number of players per game),
so that the app can adapt to different venues and match formats.

Acceptance Criteria:
An admin panel is available for configuring court count, player count, and other game parameters.
Changes in settings automatically adjust the scheduling and queue logic.
The system validates configurations to avoid scheduling conflicts.
7. Manual Override Capability
As a match organizer,
I want the option to manually override the automated queue assignment,
so that I can handle unexpected situations or adjust for special circumstances.

Acceptance Criteria:
There is a user interface for manual adjustments to the queue.
Any manual changes are logged for future reference.
The system can resume automatic scheduling after a manual override.
